### Overview
This repository contains a detailed product dissection of the Amazon e-commerce platform, focusing on the underlying methods and database schemas that power its functionality. By analyzing the key relationships and entities within the database schema, this project aims to provide insights into how Amazon manages user interactions, product inventory, and transactional data.

### Methodology
The dissection process involves breaking down the core components of the Amazon platform, including customers, orders, products, payments, shipments, and more. Each component is analyzed in terms of its relationships with other entities, establishing the foundational structure of the platform's database schema.

### Schema Description
The schema description outlines the structure of the database, detailing the entities, attributes, and relationships involved. Key aspects such as one-to-many relationships between customers and orders, products and categories, as well as the dependency relationships between carts/wishlists and customers, are highlighted to provide a comprehensive understanding of the data model.

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) visualizes the relationships between different entities in the database schema. By visualizing the connections between customers, orders, products, payments, shipments, and other entities, the ERD offers a clear representation of how data flows within the Amazon platform.
